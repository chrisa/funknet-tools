"Funknet" or "Dr VPN" feature/spec list

* Secure IP connectivity between Internet-connected sites
* Automatic provisioning of VPN tunnels among large numbers of nodes
* Detailed monitoring of network activity
* Redundant routing among nodes, with automatic failover
* Encryption and authentication of all traffic
* Central management of cryptographic keys and certificates
* Safe updating of node operating system

Secure IP connectivity via VPN: virtual private network using existing
Internet connections or dedicated lines provides a single IP network
across multiple sites.

Automatic provisioning tool: based on a single central configuration
held in a simple textual format, performs setup of all software
required on a node (tunnels, routing, monitoring, firewalling,
encryption).

Updating config: directly, or by email. Email updates provide strong
authentication and auditing of updates.

Monitoring: based on core Internet technology, network traffic,
availability and routing changes are monitored. 

Redundant routing: multiple paths are provided between nodes, and
routing software automatically selects the best path betweeen nodes,
updated constantly as availability changes. 

Encryption: using either industry-standard IPSec or efficient open
source encryption software "OpenVPN" provides interoperability between
existing equipment and ability to deal with difficult network
situations.

Central encryption management: keys are managed centrally and
provisioned to nodes as necessary.

Updating software: fully-tested images may be deployed to nodes, with
the ability to roll back to previous versions, and fall back to a
known-working setup in case of problems.
