KNOWN BUGS

(please add to this if anything doesn't work and you don't get a
sensible error messsage)

ACL lookup does the same BGP neighbour query twice

we don't make directories if they don't exist, we just crash

what user/group should we be specifying in our openvpn configs?

encryption diff isn't even started

we should warn if the live key and cert dirs are the same

the whois object parser crashes too easily (list indexes)

permissions should get set on all the cert and key files we write out.
