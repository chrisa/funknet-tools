         RAToolSet Patch for the RIPE Whois Server 3.0

The RtConfig utility provided with RAToolSet 4.6.3 requires a patch to
work properly with the RIPE Whois Server 3.0, due to the comment style
used by the RIPE server.  You can either:

1. Use your existing copy of the RAToolSet source, or download the
   RAToolSet code from:

     http://www.isi.edu/ra/RAToolSet/

   And apply the patch contained in RAToolSet-4.6.3.patch like this:

     $ patch -p0 < RAToolSet-4.6.3.patch
     $ cd RAToolSet-4.6.3
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install

2. Download and install the complete patched source, which is included
   here as:
   
     RAToolSet-4.6.3-RIPE.tar.gz

You need to make sure you specify the BIRD protocol, not the RIPE
protocol when using RtConfig:

  $ RtConfig -h rpsl.ripe.net -protocol bird

We plan on releasing a protocol for RtConfig that works better with the
RIPE 3.0 Whois Server, but this seems to work.  Please send any problems
you experience with the patch to <dbrip@ripe.net>, or post them to the
<db-beta@ripe.net> mailing list (only subscribed members may post).
