This is the Funknet tools package. 

WARNING - unless you add the local_endpoint param, nothing will work.

To try the code: 

* make sure you have RtConfig available, in /usr/local/bin/RtConfig
  (or wherever you set in lib/Funknet/Config/AccessList.pm).

Run config.pl as:
$ ./config.pl -f funknet.conf

valid local_router types: ios, zebra
valid local_os types: ios, solaris, bsd, linux
set local_host to your router, which might well be 127.0.0.1
set local_endpoint to your tunnel endpoint as shown in your
tunnel objects.

* make sure there's a password set in Funknet::Config::CLI::Secrets.pm
  that matches your local_host.

This will generate a bunch of output - all of STDERR is Perl's I
think. First you'll get a dump of the config as it should look, based
on the whois. Then you get a dump of the config as it is, but
generated from the system's internal data structures.

Finally you'll get a list of commands required to convert one to the
other, near enough.
