This is the Funknet tools package. 

To try the code: 

* make sure you have RtConfig available, in /usr/local/bin/RtConfig
  (or wherever you set in lib/Funknet/Config/AccessList.pm).

* run generate-tuns.pl like:

$ ./generate-tuns.pl <as number inc 'AS'> <local_router> <local_os> <local_host>

valid local_router types: ios, zebra
valid local_os types: ios, solaris, bsd, linux
set local_host to your router, which might well be 127.0.0.1

* make sure there's a password set in Funknet::Config::CLI::Secrets.pm
  that matches your local_host.

This will generate a bunch of output - all of STDERR is Perl's I
think. First you'll get a dump of the config as it should look, based
on the whois. Then you get a dump of the config as it is, but
generated from the system's internal data structures.

Finally you'll get a list of commands required to convert one to the
other, near enough.

There's also a bunch of Data::Dumper output.

I've tried this running on Solaris but against a Cisco, and running on
BSD against a local Zebra. For the purposes of this program OSX counts
as BSD.
