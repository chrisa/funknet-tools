Known bugs:

* diffing access-lists isn't done yet. this might turn out to be hard,
  or we might just replace the existing one with the whois one...

* the names of access-lists read off the router are lost - just a bug,
  it should work.

* the formatting of access-lists read off the router isn't dealt with
  at all yet, just captured and saved, so it's wrong. this might not
  matter, depending on what we do in the diff routine as we'll never
  need to send it back to the router.

* there are no tunnel commands in there yet, so ->config on a tunnel
  just prints the relevant details - but this is already split into
  OS-specific packages, so it's just a case of adding print
  statements.

* the commands don't actually work - it forgets to come out of router
  bgp mode, for instance.

* Secrets.pm needs work. I don't know how to deal with this yet, but
  I'm thinking in terms of a local config file.

* Privilege in general needs thinking about - the program only needs
  root to alter tunnels. Is userv portable enough?

* There will be a driver module which takes the place of
  generate-tuns.pl, probably called Funknet::Config.pm.

* Lots of little BGP statements are missing. There needs to be a way
  to put arbitrary extra commands in there, as well as things like
  iBGP sessions.

* Clearing of sessions should probably be more intelligent. Often it
  will decide to clear a bunch of sessions then all of them at once...

* Linux ifconfig-reading is stubbed out at the moment. 

* the IP address validation subs are stubbed out so far because all
  the CPAN modules for doing this are broken in some way.
