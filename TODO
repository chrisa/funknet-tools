=== Configuration

* diffing access-lists isn't done yet. this might turn out to be hard,
  or we might just replace the existing one with the whois one...
    -- changed - we now at least look to see if the access list
       is the same. doing more will require building a data
       structure for access lists, rather than just capturing text
    -- and that data structure is Net::ACL. You'll create access-
       list objects with Net::ACL::RtConfig, or maybe Net::ACL::
       RtConfig::SOAP.
    -- except that Net::ACL suxx0rs. We'll need to build a model under 
       Funknet::Config::AccessList::, but based on Net::ACL. 

* Privilege in general needs thinking about - the program only needs
  root to alter tunnels. Is userv portable enough? 

* Lots of little BGP statements are missing. There needs to be a way
  to put arbitrary extra commands in there -- soft reconfig is done. 

* iBGP sessions, random other bits of BGP.
    -- this should probably be covered by the 'ignore' concept. 
       ignore_neighbor, etc. 

* some network statements in the BGP configs aren't visible in 
  'sho ip bgp', so we miss them. -- is this still true?

* tests!
  -- started, in t/. 

* this persistent tunnel config malarkey -- use zebra tunnelfoo

* BGP neighbor config doesn't notice when the tunnel is for another
  router in the same AS, whereas tunnel config does (by comparing
  endpoint addresses). Neighbor config needs to use the same logic
  here as tunnels do.

* soft-reconfig -- this is applied to every neighbor, but the diff
  code doesn't yet know how to use it. -- done - does it work?

* check_login doesn't work -- just returns 1.

=== Reverse Update robot

* should check for existence of the domain object it gets sent. 

* should be doing an SOA check?

* should have some sort of human intervention mode?

=== Web Services

* should work, ideally. 

* interface to routing tables

* ability for central nodes to forward requests to correct router
