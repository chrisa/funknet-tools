Known bugs:

* There are a lot of places where we pass the static local_* values
  around from the config file. This should be replaced with calls to
  Funknet::Config::ConfigFile, at the point where the values are
  actually needed.

* diffing access-lists isn't done yet. this might turn out to be hard,
  or we might just replace the existing one with the whois one...
    -- changed - we now at least look to see if the access list
       is the same. doing more will require building a data
       structure for access lists, rather than just capturing text

* there are no tunnel commands in there yet, so ->config on a tunnel
  just prints the relevant details - but this is already split into
  OS-specific packages, so it's just a case of adding print
  statements.

* Secrets.pm needs work. I don't know how to deal with this yet, but
  I'm thinking in terms of a local config file.

* Privilege in general needs thinking about - the program only needs
  root to alter tunnels. Is userv portable enough?

* There will be a driver module which takes the place of
  generate-tuns.pl, probably called Funknet::Config.pm.

* Lots of little BGP statements are missing. There needs to be a way
  to put arbitrary extra commands in there, as well as things like
  iBGP sessions.

* Linux ifconfig-reading is stubbed out at the moment. 

* the IP address validation subs are stubbed out so far because all
  the CPAN modules for doing this are broken in some way.

* some network statements in the BGP configs aren't visible in 
  'sho ip bgp', so we miss them.
